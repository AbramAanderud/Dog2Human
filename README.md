# Dog2Human
Program that takes images of dogs and then turns them into AI using a GAN based deep learning model. The model captures dogs unique color, shape, and expression then gives you back an image of them as a human. 

# Purpose 
The main purpose is to combine AI creativity and capability with system level engineering, I will use:
- Pytorch for image to image translation
- A fastAPI backend that will let me use the model as a web API
- A PostgresSQL database that stores users results and requests
- A Redis cache that will speed up generations

# Goals
- Use AI to make something cool
- Data persistance and caching
- Scalable system design
- Integrating an ML, backend, and database
