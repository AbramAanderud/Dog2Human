| 11/12/2025| Got data and expirementing with GAN | 2|
| 11/14/2025| Training model on data and trying to fit data | 1|
| 11/17/2025| Had some bugs in generating that I had to fix and made the workflow better and easier to see results by saving image squares also using my gpu now | 2 |
| 12/02/2025| Working on flushing out front end | 2|
| 12/04/2025| Spent a couple hours spamming training runs is taking really long, will try new things later| 2|
| 12/05/2025| Worked on improving training results, trying to find best epoch | 3 |
| 12/06/2025| Trying to speed up the training process and get better results| 1 |
| 12/07/2025| Still trying to tweak hyperparameters to get better results | 1 |
| 12/08/2025| Really trying to improve my training data, my human images are good but I am trying to figure out what is best for my dog domain it is what is causing the bulk of the issues here. | 3 | 
| 12/08/2025| Unet and perceptual loss finished should get better results| 2|
| 12/08/2025| Spent time messing with hyperparameters |30 mins|
| 12/08/2025| Best training run with new hyper params and unet/perceptual loss added| 3|
| 12/09/2025| Locking in to finish front end all day getting database functionality finished| 2|
| 12/09/2025| Set up the database and the wrote all the html for the front end. Also looking into how I will deploy it if I decide to do so| 5|
| 12/09/2025| Fixing the application and making the front end look better, added a galary my project is about done. Sad my model didn't get to the performance I hoped| 3|
